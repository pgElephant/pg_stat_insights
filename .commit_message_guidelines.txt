PostgreSQL Commit Message Guidelines for NeurondB:

- The subject line must end with a period and should be concise and clear, 
  typically not exceeding a single line.

- Write commit messages in paragraph form rather than as bullet points or 
  lists, making sure to clearly communicate the content of the change.

- Do not reference specific file names or locations within the commit 
  message text.

- Omit any mention of merge or cherry-pick actions, such as "Cherry-picked 
  commit..." or "Merge commit...".

- Exclude any references to code cleanup, coding standards, or style 
  violations (e.g., "C90 violation", "cleanup", or "coding standard changes").

- Leave out references to version compatibility or APIs, such as 
  "PostgreSQL compatibility" or "API changes".

- Avoid including statements about the status of the codebase, such as 
  whether it compiles correctly or if all errors have been resolved.

- Focus exclusively on what has changed in the commit. Do not explain 
  why it was done, and do not comment on compliance with standards or 
  practices.

- The body of the message should be written in clear paragraphs, providing
  a concise narrative that describes the change, breaking details into
  additional paragraphs as necessary for clarity.

- Each line contains max 80-90 character.

Example:

Improve embedding vector normalization logic.

This commit adjusts the normalization routine to
use a more numerically stable approach, addressing
issues with denormalized input data. Additional
refactoring ensures consistent vector sizing across all 
embedding interfaces, providing clearer behavior for
callers and simplifying future maintenance.
