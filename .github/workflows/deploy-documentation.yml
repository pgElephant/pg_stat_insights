          **Advanced PostgreSQL Query Performance Monitoring Extension**

          Track 52 metrics across 11 views for comprehensive PostgreSQL query performance monitoring and optimization.
          
          ## Overview
          
          `pg_stat_insights` provides enhanced query performance monitoring for PostgreSQL 16-18, offering more metrics and views than pg_stat_statements and pg_stat_monitor combined.

          **Key Features:**

          - **52 metric columns** - Execution time, cache hits, WAL, JIT, buffer I/O
          - **11 pre-built views** - Instant access to slow queries, cache misses, I/O stats
          - **11 configuration parameters** - Fine-tune tracking and statistics
          - **Response time categorization** - Bucket queries by execution time
          - **Time-series tracking** - Historical performance analysis
          - **PostgreSQL 16, 17, 18 compatible** - Full support for latest versions

          ## Quick Install
          
          ```sql
          -- 1. Enable extension
          ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_insights';
          -- Restart PostgreSQL
          
          -- 2. Create extension
          CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_insights;
          
          -- 3. View slowest queries
          SELECT query, calls, total_exec_time, mean_exec_time
          FROM pg_stat_insights_top_by_time
          LIMIT 10;
          ```

          ## Why pg_stat_insights?

          - **Find slow queries** - Identify performance bottlenecks quickly
          - **Optimize cache usage** - Detect buffer cache inefficiencies
          - **Track WAL generation** - Monitor write-ahead log overhead
          - **Real-time monitoring** - Integrate with Grafana dashboards
          - **100% test coverage** - 150 TAP tests ensure reliability

          # Installation Guide
          
          ## Prerequisites
          
          - PostgreSQL 16, 17, or 18
          - Build tools: gcc, make
          - PostgreSQL development headers
          
          ## Build from Source
          
          ```bash
          # Download source
          git clone https://github.com/pgelephant/pg_stat_insights.git
          cd pg_stat_insights
          
          # Build and install
          make
          sudo make install
          ```

          ## PostgreSQL Configuration

          Add to `postgresql.conf`:

          ```ini
          shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_insights'
          ```
          
          Restart PostgreSQL:
          
          ```bash
          # Linux
          sudo systemctl restart postgresql
          
          # macOS
          pg_ctl restart -D /path/to/data
          ```
          
          ## Create Extension
          
          ```sql
          CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_insights;
          ```
          
          ## Verify Installation
          
          ```sql
          SELECT extname, extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_stat_insights';
          ```

          Expected output:
          ```
               extname      | extversion
          ------------------+------------
           pg_stat_insights | 1.0

          ```sql
          SELECT 
              query,
              calls,
              total_exec_time,
              mean_exec_time,
              stddev_exec_time
          FROM pg_stat_insights_top_by_time
          LIMIT 10;
          ```

          ## Step 4: Check Cache Performance
          
          ```sql

              ROUND(100.0 * shared_blks_hit / NULLIF(shared_blks_hit + shared_blks_read, 0), 2) as cache_hit_ratio
          FROM pg_stat_insights_top_cache_misses
          LIMIT 10;
          ```
          
          ## Step 5: Monitor Most Frequent Queries
          
          ```sql
          SELECT 
              query,
              calls,
              mean_exec_time,
              rows

          ```
          PostgreSQL + pg_stat_insights
                    ↓
              postgres_exporter (custom queries)
                    ↓
                Prometheus (time-series DB)
                    ↓
              Grafana (visualization)
          ```

          ## Setup postgres_exporter

          ### Install postgres_exporter
          
          ```bash
          wget https://github.com/prometheus-community/postgres_exporter/releases/download/v0.15.0/postgres_exporter-0.15.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

          # Feature Comparison

          How pg_stat_insights compares to pg_stat_statements and pg_stat_monitor.

          ## Metrics Comparison

          | Feature | pg_stat_statements | pg_stat_monitor | pg_stat_insights |
          |---------|:------------------:|:---------------:|:----------------:|
          | Metric Columns | 44 | 58 | **52** |
          | Pre-built Views | 2 | 5 | **11** |
          | Configuration | 5 | 12 | **11** |
          | Cache Analysis | Basic | Basic | **Enhanced** |
          | Response Time Categories | No | No | **Yes** |
          | Time-Series Tracking | No | No | **Yes** |
          | TAP Test Coverage | Standard | Limited | **150 tests** |
          | Documentation | Basic | Medium | **30+ pages** |
          | Prometheus Integration | Manual | Manual | **Pre-built** |

          ## When to Use pg_stat_insights

          - Need more than basic query statistics
          - Want pre-built analytical views
          - Require Prometheus/Grafana integration
          - Need response time categorization
          - Want comprehensive test coverage
          - Need detailed documentation

          ## Migration from pg_stat_statements

          pg_stat_insights is a drop-in replacement:

          ```sql
          -- Replace
          SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements;
          -- With
          SELECT * FROM pg_stat_insights;
          ```

          All pg_stat_statements columns are included plus 8 additional columns.

          # Parameters Reference

          Complete reference for all 11 pg_stat_insights configuration parameters.

          ## Parameters

          See [Configuration Guide](configuration.md) for detailed descriptions and examples.

          ### Quick Reference

          | Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
          |-----------|------|---------|-------------|
          | `pg_stat_insights.max` | integer | 5000 | Max queries tracked |
          | `pg_stat_insights.track` | enum | top | Which queries to track |
          | `pg_stat_insights.track_utility` | boolean | on | Track utility commands |
          | `pg_stat_insights.track_planning` | boolean | off | Track planning time |
          | `pg_stat_insights.save` | boolean | on | Save on shutdown |

          ## Tuning Recommendations

          - **Development:** Set `max = 1000`, `track = 'all'`
          - **Production:** Set `max = 10000`, `track = 'top'`
          - **High-traffic:** Increase `max` to 50000+
